# Audiobook Server
A server for hosting audiobooks and related information.

*Note: This used to be the mono-repo of both the server and client. After rewriting the project I've moved away from using a mono repo. See [Audiobook Suite](https://github.com/pfeiferj/audiobook-suite) for the integrated solution.*
